## 🧩 LEVEL 4

Time was broken — not once, but twice.
To understand the cure, you must preserve the damage.


## 🧩 Your Mission
- Recreate a timeline where:
- Something is **correct**
- Then it is **broke**
- Then someone tries to fix it… but fails so it is **failed-fix**
- Finally, time is healed — without erasing the past
- The **artifact** remembers everything.

## 🧠 Rules of Time

The timeline must contain multiple moments

The artifact must survive every moment

You may undo, but never erase

If the past disappears, the trial is failed

Choose your actions carefully.
Time does not forgive shortcuts.

## 🕯️ Whispers from the Past

“When it was whole, it spoke plainly.”
“When it broke, the truth was exposed.”
“When the fix failed, the mistake became obvious.”

History listens to what you say when you commit.
